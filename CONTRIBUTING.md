### Pull Request Process:

1. **Fork** the repository.
2. **Create a new branch** for your feature or bug fix:  
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   
3. Make your changes, ensuring they follow the project's coding standards.
4. **Commit your changes**
5. **Push** your branch to your fork:  
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```
6. **Open a pull request**, detailing the changes you've made and linking to relevant issues.

### Pull Request Guidelines

- Focus your pull request on a single feature or fix.
- Ensure your code is well-tested and passes all checks.

## Code Style Guidelines

To maintain code consistency, please adhere to the following style guidelines:
- **Flask & Python**:
  - Follow [PEP 8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) coding standards.
  - Use type hints when possible for clarity.
  - Avoid large functions; keep them modular and reusable.
- **Machine Learning**:
  - Keep your ML code modular. Use pre-trained models where applicable.
  - Ensure your model code is reproducible and well-documented.
- **HTML**:
  - Write clean and semantic HTML.
  - Stick to responsive design principles.
  
For consistency, use [Black](https://github.com/psf/black) for Python code formatting and ensure all code passes our linting checks before submission.

## Commit Message Guidelines

- **Format**: `type(scope): message`
  - Example: `feat(ML): Add new Bible verse search model`
- **Types**:
  - `feat`: A new feature
  - `fix`: A bug fix
  - `docs`: Documentation changes
  - `style`: Code style changes (formatting, missing semi-colons, etc.)
  - `refactor`: Code changes that neither fix a bug nor add a feature
